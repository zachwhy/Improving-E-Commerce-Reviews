# Improving-E-Commerce-Reviews

In this project, I collaborated with a team to extract over 4000 reviews and perform sentiment analysis on more than 10 products to assist sellers in better branding themselves in their targeted market. To ensure stakeholders received accurate competitor analysis of the target market in Singapore, we filtered out approximately 95% of non-informative reviews using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Through automation, we were able to label reviews after inferring clusters derived using Latent Dirichlet Allocation, streamlining the process. By utilizing the BERT deep learning model, we achieved close to 90% accuracy in performing sentiment analysis on product reviews. Our work provided invaluable insights and drove growth for stakeholders, helping them make more informed decisions about their products and market positioning.
