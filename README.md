# Improving-E-Commerce-Reviews

In this project, we scraped reviews from a leading e-commerce website and segregated informative reviews from irrelevant ones. In doing so, we were able to obtain a more accurate picture of the market. We took advantage of Latent Dirichlet Allocation to label the reviews into different clusters and performed sentiment analysis using a Bert model from Huggingface.
